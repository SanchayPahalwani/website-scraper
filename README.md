## Extending the Tool

To add new storage or notification strategies, create new classes in the respective directories that inherit from the base classes.

## Error Handling

The tool implements robust error handling and logging. Check the console output or log files for detailed information about the scraping process and any errors encountered.

## Scalability

For large datasets, consider using the database instead of `JsonFileStorage`. You may need to implement database migrations for your specific database schema.
